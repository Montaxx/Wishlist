# Wishlist
A simple wishlist with MySQL-Connection and Bootstrap. Very dirty and not for everyday-use.
Please do NEVER use it on a live-system. It has several security-issues I don't want to deal with at this time.
This project was only for demonstration and test purposes.

# To-Do
* Sum up costs and put it somewhere
* Fix the SQL-Injections and XSS's

# Installation
1. Edit MySQL-Connection in index.php
2. Import db.sql (or create it on your own)
